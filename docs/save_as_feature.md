# Save As Feature Plan

## Goal
Introduce a "Save As" workflow that allows users to export the current analysis session to a new location without overwriting the existing file.

## Initial Tasks
- Audit existing save logic within the application.
- Define UI/CLI entry point for the Save As action.
- Determine file format and validation requirements for the new target file.
- Draft integration tests to cover the Save As flow.

## Open Questions
- Should Save As duplicate all metadata or allow custom metadata overrides?
- How should conflicts be handled if the destination file already exists?
- Are there platform-specific path constraints that we need to enforce?

## Next Steps
1. Review current persistence module to identify extension points.
2. Outline acceptance criteria and update documentation accordingly.
3. Prototype the Save As command behind a feature flag.
